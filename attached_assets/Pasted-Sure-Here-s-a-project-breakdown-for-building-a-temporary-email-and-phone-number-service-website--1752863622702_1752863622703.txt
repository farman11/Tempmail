Sure! Here's a project breakdown for building a temporary email and phone number service website:

---

### **Project Overview:**

The goal is to create a platform that allows users to generate temporary, disposable email addresses and phone numbers. This service aims to help users protect their real identities, avoid spam, and securely access online services without compromising personal information. The platform will support features such as temporary email inboxes, SMS OTP verification, and privacy protection.

### **Key Features:**

1. **Temporary Email Generation:**

   * Users can create temporary, anonymous email addresses that self-destruct after a set time or after email retrieval.
   * Support for receiving and reading emails through a disposable inbox.
   * Ability to forward emails to a user's real email address if needed.

2. **Temporary Phone Number Generation:**

   * Generate temporary phone numbers for receiving SMS OTP verification codes.
   * One-time use or temporary phone numbers for verification purposes.
   * Ability to forward OTPs and verification messages to a user's real phone number or email.

3. **Anonymity and Privacy Protection:**

   * No registration required, users can access the service without providing any personal information.
   * Temporary emails and phone numbers are not tied to the user's real identity.
   * Emails and phone numbers are destroyed after the time expires or after a user manually deletes them.

4. **Spam Protection:**

   * Automatically filters out spam and promotional emails from disposable addresses.
   * Users can create multiple email addresses for different tasks (e.g., signing up for different services).

5. **User Interface:**

   * Simple and intuitive design for generating temporary emails/phone numbers.
   * Options to view and manage temporary inboxes and delete old email addresses/phone numbers.
   * Users can copy email addresses or phone numbers directly to clipboard for quick use.
